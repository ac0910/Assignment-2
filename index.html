    <p>Bareilly, city, northwest-central Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. It is situated just east of the Ramganga River (a tributary of the Ganges [Ganga] River), about 130 miles (210 km) east-southeast of Delhi.

The city, founded in 1537, was built largely by the Mughal governor Makrand Ray. It later became the capital of the Rohillas, a migrant Afghan clan that gained control of the surrounding territory. In 1774, during the Rohilla War, the ruler of Oudh (Ayodhya) conquered the area with British aid, and Bareilly was ceded to the British in 1801. It was a centre of the 1857–58 Indian Mutiny against British rule.
<br>
Bareilly is situated at a major rail and road junction and is a trade centre for agricultural products. Industries include sugar processing and cotton ginning and pressing. The city is the site of MJP Rohilkhand University (founded 1975) and Bareilly College (1837), and the Indian Veterinary Research Institute is in the city’s northern Izatnagar district. The Invertis Institute of Management Studies (1998), now part of Invertis University, is just southeast of the city.. Bareilly has many fine mosques. The ancient fortress city of Ahicchattra near Bareilly is believed to have been visited by the Buddha. Pop. (2001) 718,395; (2011) 903,668.<br>
